						<h1>Heating stage</h1>
					</header>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<h4>Rationale</h4>
					<p>
						The wedge-bonding procedure requires the chip to be placed on a heated bed as it was anticipated
						in the <a href="project_overview.html#wire_bonding">project overview</a>.
						The heated bed needs to be at a temperature of 150°C for the wedge-bonding procedure to be
						performed efficiently and correctly.
					</p>
					<h4>The thermal model</h4>
					<p>
						It is well known that thermal systems can be modeled using electrical equivalents by following
						these rules:
					<ul>
						<li>Heat current is equivalent to electrical current;</li>
						<li>Temperature is equivalent to voltage;</li>
						<li>Ambient temperature is equivalent to electrical ground;</li>
						<li>Heat conduction of materials is equivalent to resistance;</li>
						<li>Heat capacity of materials is equivalent to electrical capacitance.</li>
					</ul>
					Therefore, a body connected to a heat source can be modeled as a RC network like the one depicted in
					the figure in the paragraph below.

					<h2>Driving the heating stage</h2>
					<h4>Strategy</h4>
					<p>
						<span class="image right"><img src="images/heating_stage/thermal_model.gif" alt="" /></span>
						By applying the previous observations, the machine's heated bed can be modeled as an RC network
						like the one in the figure on the right.
					<ul>
						<li>\(q_i\) is the power generator. In our application, \(q_i\) will be the electrical power
							\(V(t) \times I(t)\) dissipated by a power resistor, which will act as a heating element;
						</li>
						<li>\(\theta_a\) is the ambient temperature;</li>
						<li>\(\theta_r\) is the temperature of the heated bed. Note that, obviously, \(\theta_r >
							\theta_a\) when the heating circuit is powered up;</li>
						<li>\(C_r\) is the heat capacity of the heated bed. This capacity has a significant magnitude,
							because the heated bed is essentially a fat disk of metal (see pictures down below);</li>
						<li>\(R_{ra}\) is the heat thermal resistance of the heated bed. It discharges the heat
							capacity, allowing for the heated bed to cool down back to \(\theta_r = \theta_a\) when the
							power source is turned off.</li>
					</ul>
					</ul>
					In order to reach the correct operating temperature, i.e. \(\theta_r=150°C\), we will need a driver
					circuit which can:
					<ul>
						<li>Modulate the power source by switching it on and off at will;</li>
						<li>Measure the temperature of the heated bed \(\theta_r\);</li>
						<li>Regulate the temperature with a negative feedback loop.</li>
					</ul>
					The supply providing power to the heating element will be switched on and off through a MOSFET
					controlled by a PWM, while \(\theta_r\) will be measured using a NTC temperature sensor.
					</p>
					<p>
						The heated bed, the heating element and the temperature sensors are shown in the image cluster
						below:s

						<li><b>Top-right</b>: the NTC and its support mounted on the underside of the heated bed;</li>
						<li><b>Bottom-left</b>: the disassembled heated bed;</li>
