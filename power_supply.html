						<h1>Power supply</h1>
					</header>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						As the bonding machine requires is composed of many different subsystems (heater, motor, driver boards, etc.)
						which operate at different supply voltages, we need to design a power supply unit (PSU) which can provide many
						power rails in a similar fashion to an ATX supply for desktop computers.
						<br>
						Unfortunately, ATX PSUs are too big to fit in the electronics panel of our bonding machine and furthermore they
						don't provide all the voltages we need. As you will see below, we decided to use a single rail AC/DC converter
						with a cascade of buck converters to get all the voltages we need.  
					</p>

					<h2>PSU in detail</h2>
					<h4>Block scheme</h4>
					<p>
						The block scheme of our PSU can be seen in the image below.
						<br><br>
						As expected, the 24V rail is connected to the more
						power hungry elements of the system, mainly the heater and the solenoids which require a lot of current to be
						operated (2A for the first, around 0.5A each for the latter). The ultrasonic driver is less demanding in terms
						of current, as it's turned on at full power for a few milliseconds at most (i.e. while "soldering" the bonding
						wire onto the substrate) and it requires only around 100mA.
						<br><br>
						Motors operate at 12V. The Z and Î¸ motors draw 2A at full power, while the X and Y motor draw 0.5A at full power.
						It's important to notice that motors consume power even when they do not rotate because they actively hold the
						their position: in electric motors, holding a position requires power because the magnetic field generated by
						the coils in the rotor needs to be present at all times.
						<br>
						Fortunately, the motors consume far less than their maximum power when they are in hold (a few hundred mA at maximum depending on the static load).
						<br><br>
						A 5V rail is required to turn on the back light of the LCD, while a dual 5V rail is needed for the control
						circuitry of the ultrasonic driver. The other control circuitry (MCU board and motor driver boards) require a 3.3V.
						The current drawn in these rails is very low compared to the 12V and 24V rails.

					<h4>Schematic and PCB</h4>
					<p>
						The schematic and the PCB derived from the block scheme are reported below.
						There are some important points to discuss:
						<ul>
							<li>The 3.3V is absent as the regulator will be mounted on the master board's PCB (see <a href="master_board.html">here</a>).
								The slave boards are currently powered with the 3.3V rail coming from the NUCLEO-H723ZG we're currently using 
								as the main brains of the machine;</li>
							<li>The 12V and 5V are ready-made, low cost buck regulators from China which are usually sold to power 
								DC motors. It didn't make economical sense to 
								spend time designing a completely custom power supply as these basic commercial solution are good enough
								for our application.  </li>
							<li>We decided to opt for a commercial solution for the 24V flyback PSU as well. These PSUs are usually
								sold as strip LED drivers and are cheap and commonly available. The PSU we used for our
								project was actually given us for free because the original owner thought it was broken and wanted
								to throw it away;</li>
							<li>The -5V rail is obtained through a bootstrap circuit which uses the switching signal coming from the
								5V buck regulator. This way we don't have to build a separate clock signal, reducing component count;
							</li>
							<li>The PSU PCB also hosts the transistors used to activate the head solenoids (discussed above and
								<a href="mechanical_description.html">seen here</a>), the lamp and the heating stage's power resistor
								(see <a href="heating_stage.html">here</a>). The solenoids and the lamp are controlled with BDX53s while
								the heater relies on a PMV20XNER SMD power MOSFET.</li>
						</ul>
