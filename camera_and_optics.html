						<h1>Camera and optics</h1>
					</header>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						To achieve a precision of a few microns when positioning the machine head we can't possibly rely
						on human vision, which is different from individual to individual and can resolve objects of around
						100 microns at maximum.
						<br>
						This implies that we need image amplification through a microscope. The original machine had an optical
						binocular microscope as it can be seen in the <a href="project_overview.html">project overview</a>,
						but unfortunately it wasn't included along with the machine head we bought.	This meant we had to
						build our own from scratch.
						<br><br>
						We actually equipped the machine with two cameras:
						<ul>
							<li>A custom CMOS microscope mounted on the top: this will be used to implement the full automatic bonding procedure,
							which hasn't yet been implemented (see <a href="closing_remarks.html#future_work">here</a> for further details);</li>
							<li>A commercial microscope lens mounted on the front: this is used to perform the manual bond procedure, as it can be seen
								<a href="bonding_the_proper_way.html">here</a>. This camera is also helpful when loading the 25 micron gold wire spool into the 
								wedge tool.
							</li>
							
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h4>Custom CMOS camera microscope</h4>
					<p>
						A basic microscope was created by positioning a suitable optical lens and a CMOS camera at the opposite
						ends of a metal extension tube as it can be seen in the picture below. This is the same approach that
						amateur photographers use to take macro pictures on DSLR cameras without having to buy expensive
						dedicated macro lenses.
						<br><br>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="media/camera_and_optics/lens.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						
						The CMOS camera is connected to a ESP32 through an ESP32-CAM module; the ESP32 is connected to a PC
						through a dedicated Wi-Fi connection. This allows us to access the camera wirelessly, which simplifies
						the wiring of the machine, which is already rather complex.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Image gallery</h4>
					<p>
						In the gallery below we show some pictures of the camera calibration objects.
						<ul>
							<li><b>Top-left</b>: coarse calibration reference object;</li>
							<li><b>Top-right</b>: fine calibration reference object;</li>
							<li><b>Bottom-left</b>: detail of the circular drawing of the fine calibration object;</li>
							<li><b>Bottom-right</b>: circular drawing seen through the microscope (see the text below for a detailed description).</li>
						</ul>

						We now focus on the bottom-right image, which shows the circular drawing of the calibration tool (see the
						bottom-left picture) as seen under the microscope. 
						<br><br>
						The camera sensor is 3590x2684 microns and the microscope we built (see image above) has a x3.9 magnification.
						Therefore, the resulting field of view is 920x688 microns. This can be observed in the bottom-right image:
						Each long line represents a 100 microns division, which is in turn divided in 10 subdivisions of 10 microns each.
						<br>
						By counting the divisions we can see that the actual field of view matches the calculations above.

					<h2>Front camera module</h2>
					<p>
						Along with the microscope camera, the bonding machine is equipped with a frontal microscope camera
						(with significant less magnification compared to the camera mounted on the extension tube discussed above) 
						which is used to monitor the operating area of the machine. This allows us to roughly align the head
						above the substrate and check that the bond is being formed correctly. The camera module is 
						manufactured by Hayear and can be found on <a href="https://www.hayear.com/?product/189">their website</a>.
						found on 
						<br>
						A small image gallery is reported below.

							<li><b>Bottom</b>: camera stream viewed from a PC.</li>

					<h2>Future work</h2>
					<h4>Camera and LCD display</h4>
					<p>
						Our goal for the future is to use an independent touchscreen display that can be mounted on
						the machineâ€™s frame, for which we have already built a prototype as seen in the <a href="LCD_and_RAM.html">LCD</a>
						section. We decided not to focus on this additional step at this stage of the project, as we considered
						it to be of secondary importance.
