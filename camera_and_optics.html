					<h2>Custom CMOS camera microscope</h2>

					<h4>Rationale</h4>
					<p>
						To achieve a precision of a few microns when positioning the machine head we can't possibly rely
						on human vision, which is different from individual to individual and can resolve objects of around
						100 microns at maximum.
						<br>
						This implies that we need image amplification through a microscope. The original machine had an optical
						binocular microscope as it can be seen in the <a href="project_overview.html">project overview</a>,
						but unfortunately it wasn't included along with the machine head we bought.	This meant we had to
						build our own from scratch.
					</p>

					<h4>Our design</h4>
					
					<p>
						A basic microscope was created by positioning a suitable optical lens and a CMOS camera at the opposite
						ends of a metal extension tube as it can be seen in the picture below. This is the same approach that
						amateur photographers use to take macro pictures on DSLR cameras without having to buy expensive
						dedicated macro lenses.
						<br><br>

						The CMOS camera is connected to a ESP32 through an ESP32-CAM module; the ESP32 is connected to a PC
						through a dedicated Wi-Fi connection. This allows us to access the camera wirelessly, which simplifies
						the wiring of the machine, which is already rather complex.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Image gallery</h4>
					<p>
						What can be observed when a generic die is placed under the microscope is shown in the figure (mettere foto con dimensioni).

					<h2>Future work</h2>
					<h4>Camera and LCD display</h4>
					<p>
						Our goal for the future is to use an independent touchscreen display that can be mounted on
						the machineâ€™s frame, for which we have already built a prototype as seen in the <a href="LCD_and_RAM.html">LCD</a>
						section. We decided not to focus on this additional step at this stage of the project, as we considered
						it to be of secondary importance.
