					<h4>Titolo sottoparagrafo</h4>
					<p>To achieve a microscopic-scale vision, a basic microscope was created by positioning a suitable optical
					   lens and a CMOS camera at the opposite ends of a metal extension tube. The CMOS camera was then connected
					   to a PC using the ESP32-CAM module. What can be observed when a generic die is placed under the
					   microscope is shown in the figure (mettere foto con dimensioni). We are happy with the result achieved;
					   however, our goal for the future is to use an independent touchscreen display that can be mounted on the
					   machineâ€™s frame, for which we have already built a prototype (foto). We do not plan to focus on this
					   additional step at this stage of the project, as we consider it to be of secondary importance.</p>
