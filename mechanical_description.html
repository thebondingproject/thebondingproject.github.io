					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<h4>The original frame</h4>
					<p>
						As it was reported in an image in the <a href="project_overview.html#the_machine">project
							overview</a>, the original bonding machine is essentially a bulky 4-axis robot. It's
						composed of two main elements:
					<ul>
						<li>The heated bed: it allows for horizontal movement of along the X and Y axes;</li>
						<li>The machine head: it's mounted at a fixed height, but its internals can move vertically
							along Z and can also rotate along θ.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<h4>Rebuild challenges</h4>
					<p>
						We needed build a frame to allow movement along the four axis with micrometer precision. This
						immediately raises three problems:
					<ul>
						<li>How can we achieve micrometer precision while keeping costs sufficiently down?</li>
						<li>How do we stop the bed from smashing accidentally against the metal frame? How do we prevent
							over-rotation of the machine head?</li>
						<li>How do we set the zeros of X, Y, Z and θ reliably?</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h2>The new frame</h2>
					<h4>Overview</h4>
					<p>
						The current state of the machine frame is depicted in the images below.
						The frame which supports the machine head was built from scratch, together with the motor
						mounts, the travel limiting sensors and the encoders’ mounts.
						The latter are discussed in detail in the <a href="motor_control.html">motor control</a> page.
						In the following section we will show the X, Y, Z, θ axes in greater detail, which use three
						different methods to achieve motion.

					<h4>X, Y mechanism and limit switches</h4>
					<p>
						The image cluster below shows the X and Y axis mechanisms in greater detail.
					<ul>
						<li><b>Top-left</b>: the heated bed is moved through a screw mechanism which translates the
							rotational movement of the servo motors into linear motion.
							The horizontal screw has a pitch of 0.75mm, meaning that for each revolution of the screw
							the heated bed moves horizontally by 0.75mm.
							This allows for great horizontal precison, which will enable us to achieve the desidered
							micrometer precision that we need to perform the bonds;
						</li>
						<li><b>Top-right</b>: a detail of the X motor;</li>
						<li><b>Bottom-left</b>: an animation of the screw mechanism to convert the rotational motion of
							the motor into linear horizontal motion;</li>
						<li><b>Bottom-right</b>: detail of the mechanical limit switch of the X axis. These switch are
							normally open; when they get hit by the heated bed, they form a short which is dected by the
							machine's MCU, which in turn proceeds to immediately halt the motors.</li>

					</ul>

					<h4>Z, θ mechanism and limit switches</h4>
					<p>
						The image cluster below shows the Z and θ axis mechanisms in greater detail.
					<ul>
						<li><b>Top-left</b>: the Z motor moves the machine head up and down using a slider-crank
							mechanism, while the θ rotates the operating head with a belt drive mechanism;</li>
						<li><b>Top-right</b>: a detail of the Z and θ mechanisms. The belt drive of θ was not visibile
							in the top-left image;</li>
						<li><b>Bottom-left</b>: an outline of a slider-crank mechanism;</li>
						<li><b>Bottom-right</b>: highlight of the optical limit switches of the Z movement. The θ axis
							has optical limit switches as well, but they cannot be esily seen fron the outside and
							therefore they haven't been shown here. These switches are normally closed. When the light
							path gets interrupted by excessive travel or due to the gold bonding wire snapping
							accidentally, the machine gets immedately halted by the MCU.</li>
					</ul>
