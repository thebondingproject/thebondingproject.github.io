						In the <a href="camera_and_optics.html">camera and optics</a> section we stated that we currently
						view the camera from a PC connected wirelessly to an ESP32.
						<br>
						Our goal for the future is to use an independent touchscreen display that can be mounted on
						the machineâ€™s frame, for which we have already built a prototype as seen in the  <a href="LCD.html">LCD</a>
						section. We decided not to focus on this additional step at this stage of the project, as we considered
						it to be of secondary importance.
