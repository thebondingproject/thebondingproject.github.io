						<h1>Motor control</h1>
					</header>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
					The bonding machine needs to control 4 independent axes (X, Y, Z and Î¸) with 4 motors as already described in the
					<a href="mechanical_description.html">mechanical description</a>.
					<br>
					We decided to keep the master control unit (MCU) separate from the motor drivers.
					Each driver is a slave board communicates with the MCU through a custom serial protocol
					(see <a href="system_architecture.html">system architecture</a>), and each motor is controlled by a separate board.
					<br>
					Each driver implements three nested PI control loops: a position loop, a speed loop and a current loop. We will
					discuss the strategy used to derive and size the various parameters to obtain smooth movement.	
					</p>

					<h2 id="pi_controller">PI controller</h2>
					<h4>PI controller: current, speed, position nested loops</h4>
					<p>
						To implement the motor controller we followed a technical guide made by a Texas Instruments employee, namely
						"Wilson - Teaching Your PI Controller to Behave (Part II)". A PDF print of the original
						article can be found in the <a href="downloads.html#motor_control">downloads area</a> of this website.  
						<br><br>
						The complete control model is composed of three nested loops (position, speed, current). You can see the 
						three nested loops of the complete simulated system in the image below.
						<br><br>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="media/motor_driver/Servvo_block_diagram.PNG" alt="" /></span>
						The modus operandi is the following:
						<ul>
							<li>The user chooses a target position;</li>
							<li>The position loop generates a target speed to reach the target position;</li>
							<li>The speed loop generates a target current to reach the target speed;</li>
							<li>The current loop modulates the current in the motor and moves it forwards or backwards depending on the sign of the current;</li>
							<li>Position, speed and current are continuously fed back to the respective control loops.</li>
						</ul>
						We will now analyze each of the blocks to better understand their role and functioning.
					</p>

					<h4>Current PI controller</h4>
					<p>
						A generic PI controller can be modeled with the block scheme on the bottom-left. Its transfer function is
						<div class="align-center">\(PI(s) = \frac{K_a K_b}{s} + K_a  = \frac{K_a K_b \left( 1 + \frac{s}{K_b} \right)}{s} \).</div>
						<br>
						We wish to implement a current control loop to control the movement of a motor. To do this, we first take the generic PI controller scheme and
						connect the model of a DC motor to its output. The result is shown in the image on the bottom-right.
						<br><br>
						
						<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row aln-center">
							<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img
										src="media/motor_driver/pi_controller_in_general.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img
										src="media/motor_driver/pi_controller_with_output_attached.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
						</div>
						</div>
						
						This current control loop operates in the following way:
						<ul>
							<li>It receives the target current from a previous block;</li>
							<li>It actuates a change in the current to reach the target;</li>
							<li>The actual current flowing in the motor windings is measured and brought back into the input of the feedback loop.</li>
						</ul>

						The closed-loop transfer function of the system is
 						<div class="align-center">\(G(s) = \frac{G_{loop}}{1+G_{loop}} \)</div>
						where
 						<div class="align-center">\(G_{loop}(s) = \frac{G_{loop}}{1+G_{loop}} = \frac{K_a K_b \left( 1 + \frac{s}{K_b} \right)}{s}  \frac{\frac{1}{R}}{1+\frac{L}{R}s} \).</div>
						Now, by rearranging the terms we obtain
						<div class="align-center">\(G(s) = \frac{1+\frac{s}{K_b}}{\left( 1 + \frac{R}{K_a K_b} s\right) \left( 1 + \frac{s}{K_b} \right)}\).</div>
					</p>
					<h4>Choosing the parameters of the current loop</h4>
					<p>
						We aim to control the motor with smooth accelerations and decelerations, avoiding overshoots and oscillations. To achieve the performance
						we desire we need to perform zero-pole cancellation on the \(G(s)\) loop transfer function reported above.
						<br><br>
						It can be shown (see "Wilson - Teaching Your PI Controller to Behave (Part III)" in the <a href="downloads.html#motor_control">attached files</a>) that the optimal values of \(K_a\) and \(K_b\) to have zero-pole cancellation are:
						<ul>
							<li>\(K_b = \frac{R}{L}\)</li>
							<li>\(K_b = L \cdot BW\) where \(BW=2 \pi f\) is the bandwidth of the system</li>
						</ul>
						\(L\) and \(R\) were measured by following the method reported in the <a href="motor_control.html#motor_model">motor model</a> section below.
						<br>
						The system bandwidth is a degree of freedom we have to choose: more bandwidth means faster movement,
						but the system becomes more susceptible to noise. We empirically chose a bandwidth of 1kHz as the performance
						of the system was satisfactory at that frequency. 
					</p>
					
					<h4>Speed loop PI controller</h4>
					<p>
						Closing the speed loop control is more complex compared to the current loop due to the presence of the mechanical model
						of the load which is normally unknown. While the mechanical parameters of the motor are usually reported in its datasheet,
						the mechanical load actuated by the motor must be approximated using a generic low pass function like the following:
						<div class="align-center">\(Load(s) = \frac{1}{k_{\nu}+ Js}\)</div>
						where \(k_{\nu}\) is the viscous damping term and \(J\) is the inertia of the motor and the load combined.
						<br>
						The motor is modeled as
						<div class="align-center">\(Mtr(s) = \frac{3}{4}P \lambda_r \)</div>
						where \(P\) is the number of rotor poles (\(P=2\) in the case of our DC motors) and \(\lambda_r\) is the rotor flux.
						We measured \(J\) and \(P\) using a method reported in the <a href="motor_control.html#motor_model">motor model</a> section below.
						<br><br>
						The complete speed loop is shown in the image below.
						<br><br>
						<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row aln-center">
							<div class="col-9"><span class="image fit"><img
										src="media/motor_driver/pi_controller_speed.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
						</div>
						</div>
						Notice that the low pass filter in the speed feedback loop is necessary because the signal coming from the encoder (which reads the 
						motor's position) is usually very noisy: this is a problem, as noise in the feedback loop creates oscillations and
						unpredictable movement.
						<br>
						The low pass filter has the following transfer function:
						<div class="align-center">\(LPF(s) = \frac{1}{1+ \tau s}\).</div>
						Now, by imposing that \(\lambda_r=0\) (i.e., the viscous friction is negligible) we can write the complete open loop
						transfer function as
						<div class="align-center">\(GH(s) =  \frac{K_c K_d \left( 1 + \frac{s}{K_b} \right)}{s} \frac{1}{1 + \frac{L}{K_a}} \left( \frac{3}{4}P \lambda_r \right) \frac{1}{J s} \frac{1}{1+ \tau s} \) </div>
						where each of the terms is, in order:
						<ul>
							<li>Velocity PI (notice that there are two constants we need to determine, namely \(K_c\) and \(K_d\) which are the proportional and integral gains of the speed PI control loop);</li>
							<li>Closed loop current controller transfer function;</li>
							<li>Motor model transfer function;</li>
							<li>Load model transfer function;</li>
							<li>Speed measurement low pass filter.</li>
						</ul>
						Finally, the \( GH(s) \) above can be rewritten as
						<div class="align-center">\( GH(s) = \frac{K K_c K_d \left( 1 + \frac{s}{K_d} \right)}{s^2 \left( 1 + \frac{L}{K_a} s \right) \left( 1+ \tau s \right)} \)</div>
						where the term \(K = \frac{3P \lambda_r}{4 J}\) contains all the motor and load parameters
						(again, refer to the <a href="motor_control.html#motor_model">motor model</a> section below for their measurement).
						This equivalent form will be used below to find the correct values of \(K_c\) and \(K_d\). 
					</p>
					<h4>Choosing the parameters of the speed loop</h4>
					<p>
						The velocity PI has two degrees of freedom \(K_c\) and \(K_d\) which need to be determined properly to achieve
						smooth motion. 
						<br>
						The transfer function \( GH(s) \) reported in the previous section can be approximated as
						<div class="align-center">\( GH(s) \approx \frac{K K_c K_d \left( 1 + \frac{s}{K_d} \right)}{s^2 \left( 1+ \tau s \right)} \)</div>
						because the pole of the low pass filter dominates the system, as it resides at a much lower frequency
						compared to the pole of the current controller.
						<br>
						By using the concept of maximum phase margin, it can be shown (see "Wilson - Teaching Your PI Controller to Behave (Part IV)" in the <a href="downloads.html#motor_control">attached files</a>)
						that the optimal values of \(K_c\) and \(K_d\) are:
						<ul>
							<li>\(K_c = \frac{1}{\delta K \tau} \)</li>
							<li>\(K_d	 = \frac{1}{\delta^2 \tau} \)</li>
						</ul>
						where \(\delta\) is a damping factor that has been chosen empirically by trial and error until a satisfactory dynamic
						performance was found.
					</p>

					<h4 id="motor_model">Motor model</h4>
					<p>
						To build the Simulink motor model we followed the technical guide "Deriving State Equations for a DC Servo Motor" 
						that you can find in the <a href="downloads.html#motor_control">downloads area</a>. The block model (top-right) is derived
						from the differential equations of the equivalent motor-load electrical scheme (top-left). We decided not to report
						the complete derivation procedure here as it's simply a matter of converting the time domain electrical differential equations
						into the frequency domain using the Laplace transform.
						<br><br>
						We report the Simulink model of the motor and load system in the image below (bottom). The \(cos\) and \(6\) blocks on the 
						lower part of the image model the load; remember that the load is a slider-crank mechanism as we have seen in the 
						<a href="mechanical_description.html">mechanical description</a> section.

							<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img

						</div>
						</div>

						The motor parameters were found by following the technical document "DC Motor Transfer Function Estimation by Explicit Measurement"
						that you can find in the <a href="downloads.html#motor_control">downloads area</a>. Refer to the image above on the top-left for the
						following discussion.
						<ul>
							<li>Measuring \(R_a\): by locking the motor shaft we get that the back EMF \(V_b(t)\) is zero. We now impose a voltage at the
								input \(V_a(t)\) (for example 5V) and we measure the resulting current \(i_a(t)\) we can calculate
								the coil resistance as \(R_a = \frac{V_a}{i_a}\);
							</li>
							<li>Measuring \(L_a\): we keep the motor shaft locked and we calculate the inductance by measuring the time constant of the 
								equivalent RL circuit with an oscilloscope as we know that \( \tau = \frac{L_a}{R_a}\) and therefore \(L_a = \tau R_a \);
							</li>
							<li>Measuring \(\lambda_r\): we now release the motor shaft and we directly connect the supply to it. To perform
								this measurement we need to let the motor rev up to a constant speed. By observing the reference image we can write
								\(V_a = I_a R_a + \omega K_b  \), where \(K_b\) is the EMF constant. It can be shown (see this technical lecture
								by Texas Instruments on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpTvZlnrsP0&t=2623s">youtube</a> at the 43:43 timestamp)
								that the EMF constant is actually equal to the rotor flux, therefore \(K_b = \lambda_r\).
								<br>
								Therefore, by inverting the equation we obtain \(\lambda_r = K_b = \frac{V_a - I_a R_a }{\omega}\);
							</li>
							<li>Measuring \(J\): in the previous point we can also measure the viscous friction coefficient \(B = \frac{K_b I_a}{\omega}\)
								which we need to measure the system moment of inertia. The idea is the following: connect the supply to the motor,
								wait for it to reach full speed, disconnect the supply and measure the time \(\tau_m\) it takes for the motor to stop.
								We know that \(\tau_m = \frac{J}{B}\), and therefore the moment of inertia can be easily determined as \(J = B \tau_m\).
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h4>Loop models</h4>
					<p>
						You can find images all the PI controllers' Simulink models (current, speed, position) in the following image gallery; we
						decided to report them all in the same place as they are essentially all identical. As you can see they are a direct transposition
						of the scheme we reported at the top of this section. We also modeled saturations of the internal signals of the PI controller
						in order to simulate the actual implementation of these loops inside the microcontroller.
						<br> 
						You can find the Simulink files in the <a href="downloads.html#motor_control">downloads area</a> of this website.

					<h2>Further features</h2>
					<h4>Anti windup</h4>
					<p>
						All three loops also contain an anti-windup for the integrator in order to make the saturation of said integrators
						harder to reach. This allows for reduced overshoots which are very undesirable when working wich such small
						scale movements.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Motion profiling</h4>
					<p>
						<span class="image right"><img src="media/motor_driver/trapezoidal_profiling.png" alt="" /></span>

						In order to achieve smooth movement on each of the four axes we decided to implement trapezoidal motor profiling
						by following <a href="https://www.ctrlaltftc.com/advanced/motion-profiling">this article</a> (you can find a 
						PDF print of this article in the <a href="downloads.html#motor_control">downloads area</a>).
						<br><br>
						As you can see on the image on the right, by shaping the velocity target as the trapezoid (orange line), smooth
						movement can be achieved (blue line): the motor first accelerates, cruises at a constant speed for a while,
						and then decelerates smoothly when the destination is almost reached.
						<br><br>
						The control algorithm for motion profiling operates in the following way:
						<ul>
							<li> Setup phase:
								<ul>
									<li>Obtain the start and finish positions;</li>
									<li>Set the maximum acceleration and cruising speed;</li>
									<li>Calculate the speed trapezoidal profile;</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li> Movement phase (inside a while loop):
								<ul>
									<li>Calculate the setpoint position based on the trapezoidal speed profile;</li>
									<li>Command the PI controller to reach the target position;</li>
									<li>Repeat until the destination is reached.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						You can see in the video below that the motor can accelerate and slow down in a controlled manner without any jerks.

					<hr class="major" />
					
					<h2>Position sensing</h2>
					<p>
						The motor position is measured through a AS5147U-HTSM Hall effect sensor (left figure) and a diametrically magnetized
						SC35 neodymium magnet (right figure). Datasheets of both parts are available in the <a href="downloads.html">downloads area</a>.
						<br><br>
						The Hall effect sensor is able to output 1024 PPRs (Pulses Per Rotation) with optional 4x resolution, achieving
						a maximum of 4096 PPRs. This enhanced resolution is obtained by counting the rising and falling edges of both
						signals pictured in the image on the left. We decided to use this enhanced resolution mode to achieve maximum precision
						when reading the motor's position.

					<h2>Driver boards</h2>
					<h4>From demo boards to a custom PCB</h4>
					<p>
					The heart of the driver is a STM32F302R876 microcontroller by ST Microelectronics which controls a BD16912EFV-C
					motor driver IC by ROHM Semiconductor. Each manufacturer offers demo board we could buy and use for our project,
					but we decided to design our own custom PCB to host the two ICs for the following reason:
					<ul>
						<li>The STM Nucleo demo boards are expensive; the same goes for the BD16912EFV-C demo boards. It was cheaper
							to buy the individual components and assemble them on a custom PCB, as PCB manufacturing in China is very
							cheap nowadays (5 small boards cost â¬5). Shipping is actually more expensive than manufacturing, as fast shipping
							with a courier costs â¬20;</li>
						<li>Demo boards are bulky and have a lot of unnecessary headers and components; our boards contain the bare
							minimum to make the circuit work reliably, reducing the physical size of the drivers. This is important
							because we want to house all electronics in a small box mounted on the the bonding machine itself;</li>
						<li>Building custom PCBs is an important skill that cannot be taught in ordinary classroom lessons; we figured
							we could use this opportunity to consolidate our PCB design skills.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
