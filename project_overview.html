									<h4>Why the need for homemade wedge bonding?</h4>
									<p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/project_overview/SgLabs_HP_8563E_1.JPG" alt=""/></span>
									The Bonding Project is an initiative born out of necessity. We want an affordable way to repair an HP 8563E Spectrum Analyzer which is in good working condition except for the yttrium iron garnet (YIG) oscillator which has failed due to age. The component is sold as the HP 5086-7906. To be precise, the oscillator is technically working, it’s just that its frequency response is significantly degraded with respect to its specification; as a matter of fact, it works properly when operated in DC. HP was aware of this problem as it put a maximum lifetime on these components of a few hundred hours of operation.
									<br><br>
									To revive the YIG we would need to replace the worn-out BJT with a new one. Unfortunately, RF BJTs are not discrete components and therefore lie on integrated silicon dies, which are interfaced with the outside world by pads and wire bonds. Replacing this component by hand is impossible, as humans lack the ability of working with micrometer precision.
									</p>

									<h4>The problem of spares</h4>
									<p>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/project_overview/IMG-20220925-WA0012_scaled.jpg" alt=""/></span>
									Why don’t we just buy a spare? Spares for vintage precision instruments are scarcely available and sellers ask for premium prices, with listings on Ebay going for almost €900. This is unaffordable for us university students, and the cost of the part cannot be transferred to the University because said spectrum analyzer is owned by a private individual. We figured that we could attempt to perform this repair by repurposing the decommissioned head of an old wedge-bonding machine that we acquired for a significantly lower cost. This part was acquired for €293 from an internet seller from the United States, who dismantled the original machine and sold it piece by piece.	
									<br><br>
									Managing to make this unit functional would enable us to perform this kind of precision repair that no one is normally able to offer. Furthermore, we would use this machine to repair other malfunctioning instruments that we own and that we don’t want to throw away. We want to differentiate ourselves from a world driven by disposable goods and throw away culture.  
									<br><br>
									Lastly, it was the difficulty of this challenge that really drew us on. We have no defined path to follow: we just know we must make it work somehow. We think it will be an excellent learning opportunity which will enable us to merge all the knowledge we accumulated during our studies, as this project will touch almost every area belonging to the field of Electronic Engineering: control theory, power electronics, microprocessor programming, optics, and so on.

									<h2>The machine</h2>
									<h4>Buying the machine head</h4>
									<p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/project_overview/picture-1.jpg" alt=""/></span>
									The machine from which the head comes from is a Kulicke Soffa 1470. Information is very, very scarce: there are some photos of the original machine body on technology surplus websites, but no manuals and no technical information is readily available. We managed to find two people who had experience with this machine only, and both resided in the United States. We tried to reach them through the internet, but only one responded and, unfortunately, wasn’t particularly keen on helping us. We asked him for scans of the original manual; he sent a few photos and then never responded again.
									<br><br>
									The original machine looks like the one in figure. It’s essentially a finely controlled and highly specialized 4-axis robot not too dissimilar from a very expensive 3D-printer. We only own the operating head, i.e. the part of the machine that is directly responsible for performing the bond. The frame, the motors, the motor drivers, the control circuitry, the manual, the embedded microscope, and so on are missing. 
									</p>

									<h4>Current state of the project</h4>
									<p>
									There’s a lot of work to be done. To make it functional we must build the following elements from scratch:
									<ul>
										<li>DC motor servo drivers;</li>
										<li>Heater (temperature controller);</li>
										<li>HMI (Camera, TFT, joystick and buttons);</li>
										<li>Head Solenoids driver;</li>
										<li>Ultrasonic driver;</li>
										<li>Elaboration process (bond procedures, pattern recognition).</li>	
									</ul>

									<span class="image left"><img src="images/project_overview/machine_head_scaled.jpg" alt=""/></span>
									We have already built the ultrasonic driver as we needed to test if the machine head was working at all when we bought it.  As we’ll see afterwards, the ultrasonic element is a highly specialized part that has a fundamental role in the wedge bonding procedure. It would’ve made no sense to proceed further in the rebuild if this element was broken. Furthermore, the heating element is currently a WIP in another University of Udine lab project.
									<br><br>
									The current state of the machine is depicted in the image on the side. The 4-axial frame which supports the machine head was built from scratch, together with the motor mounts, the travel limiting sensors and the encoders’ mounts. 
									<br><br>
									This website will act as a journal. We will guide you on our journey of the development of the motor control boards, the implementation of the control algorithms and the master system control board which will coordinate all operations.
