						<h1>Making the first bond</h1>

					<h2>Setup</h2>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>
						Once we mounted the motor drivers on the frame of the machine (see the <a href="motor_control.html">motor control</a>
						section) and got the master-slave communication working (see the <a href="system_architecture.html">system architecture</a>
						section) we were ready to perform the first bond test.
						<br><br>
						The MCU we used was a NUCLEO-H723ZG board. The whole setup was powered using three bench power supplies as we haven't yet
						designed a suitable custom power supply for the whole apparatus. You can see a photo of the setup in the image below.

					<h4>STM32CubeMonitor control interface</h4>
					<p>
						As we didn't have the master PCB ready yet nor the LCD screen and the camera, we used the STM32CubeMonitor software
						to create a basic control UI as described in the images below.
						<br>
						The bond is perfomed by pressing the "bond" button, which turns on the ultrasonic driver to full power for 250ms.
						This timing has to be precise: if it lasts too little the wire doesn't have enough time to melt; if it lasts
						too long the bond gets formed and then detaches due excessive stimulation.

					<h2>Performing the bond</h2>
					The bonding prcedure was perfomed by following the following steps:
					<ul>
						<li>Position the bed by manipulating the XY coordinates;</li>
						<li>Make the head descend by manipulating the Z coordinate;</li>
						<li>Close the clamp solenoid;</li>
						<li>Activate the ultrasonic driver;</li>
						<li>Open the clamp solenoid;</li>
					</ul>
					
					As the Z motor was not yet calibrated, the descent of the machine head was aided by manual
					human intervetion. The XY movement, on the other hand, required no outside help.
					<br>
					The following video shows the bonding procedure we managed to perform with this setup.
