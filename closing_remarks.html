					<h2>Results and future work</h2>
					<p>
						In this website we've gone through the development of various parts of the bonding machine.
						<ol>
							<li>We started by defining the general master-slave architecture of the machine and we wrote a custom communication
								protocol suited for our needs (see <a href="system_architecture.html">here</a>);
							</li>
							<li>We designed and built the ultrasonic driver PCB to drive the ultrasonic welding element (see <a href="ultrasonic_driver.html">here</a>);</li>
							<li>We implemented a nested PI controller with trajectory profiling for the 4 motors, achieving reliable and smooth motion. We also designed and built custom PCBs for the controllers (see <a href="motor_control.html">here</a>);</li>
							<li>We implemented another PI controller to control the heating stage (see <a href="heating_stage.html">here</a>);</li>
							<li>We built a custom microscope with a CMOS camera to be able to accurately position the machine head on the substrate (see <a href="camera_and_optics.html">here</a>);</li>
							<li>We built a modular power supply (24V, 12V, 5V, 3.3V) by cascading multiple buck converters (see <a href="power_supply.html">here</a>)</li>
							<li>By manually assisting the machine, we were able to perform a first bond test (see <a href="making_the_first_bond.html">here</a>);</li>
							<li>We almost fully automatized the bonding procedure (head descent and raise, ultrasonic driver activation, solenoid actuation) and successfully managed to bond a test substrate (see <a href="proper_bond.html">here</a>);</li>
						</ol>
						We are very satisfied with the results we achieved. However, there are a few things we need to implement and refine.
						<ol>
							<li>We want to display the camera output onto a LCD screen, and we also want to be able to control the machine through a touchscreen. We're
								currently stuck as we haven't been able to reliably connect the external RAM to the MCU due to crosstalk and other 
								parasitic effects caused by long interconnections (see <a href="LCD_and_RAM.html">here</a>);</li>
							<li>We haven't yet designed a custom PCB for the MCU as its design is not yet finalized. Unforeseen changes requiring PCB redesign might 
								appear during development, and we can't afford to make many test PCBs. We need to nail it on the first try (see <a href="master_board.html">here</a>).</li>
						</ol>

						We now report a small before/after image gallery so you can compare the state of the project before and after the making
