								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								
								<h4>The first step in the rebuild</h4>
								<p>The ultrasonic driver control board was the first thing built as we needed to check if the machine head was working at all. As we have already seen in the <a href="project_overview.html#wire_bonding">project overview</a>, the ultrasonic element is a highly specialized part that has a fundamental role in the wedge bonding procedure. It wouldâ€™ve made no sense to proceed further in the rebuild if this element was broken. </p>

								<h4>Modeling ultrasonic drivers</h4>
								<p>
									Langevin ultrasonic transducers are composed of two piezoelectric disks held together with a bolt which prevents them from separating during operation.
									Piezoelectric crystals vibrate when they get electrically stimulated by injecting a sine wave into their contacts. The frequency of the stimulating signal must be chosen carefully as ultrasonic transducers must be operated in proximity of their resonant frequency.
									A negative feedback driver regulates the input frequency in order to always keep the ultrasonic transducer at the optimal working point. 
									This is similar to what happens in quartz oscillators used to generate clock signals, as they also feature a negative feedback loop to keep the crystal in its inductive working region near its resonant frequency.

									The mechanical elements which compose the Langevin ultrasonic transducer shown above can be modeled with the scheme on the left. This scheme resonates at frequency \(f_1\) which has the expression
