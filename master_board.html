					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<h4>Rationale</h4>
					<p>
					As anticipated in the <a href="system_architecture.html">system architecture</a>, the master board contains
					the true brains of the machine, the Master Control Unit (MCU). Its job is to control the slave motor drivers,
					the heater, the ultrasonic element, etc.
					</p>

					<h4>Building a custom PCB</h4>
					<p>
					Same as in the <a href="motor_control.html">slave driver boards</a> we decided to build a custom PCB for the master
					control board. Building the board by hand is unthinkable, as there are too many connections to make (the LCD screen,
					the external RAM, the serial communication with the slaves and so on).
					Using a ST Nucleo with tens of jumpers would be bulky and unreliable. Wires must not disconnect or move when
					moving the bonding machine and furthermore the circuit operates in the MHz frequency range, making connections
					length and layout important.
					</p>
